The XTCE Tools Java JAR file supports the XTCE technology by providing a
Graphical User Interface named "xtceview" to view/browse/edit an XTCE
document.  It also provides a non-graphical underlying "toolkit" package to
enable application developers to create a specialized application that uses an
XTCE document, with minimal effort, when compared to attempting the task
without the toolkit.

The toolkit does not depend on any graphical interfaces.  To complement, the
graphical user interface "xtceview" contains little to no business logic,
preferring to be a graphical wrapper around the toolkit package.  To
supplement this, a number of examples, sample databases, and schema
documentation are also included.  All documentation can be accessed from
this Help Menu, assuming that the Java FX libraries are available on startup.
