    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>The XTCE Tools Java JAR file supports the XTCE technology by providing a
        Graphical User Interface named "xtceview" to view/browse/edit an XTCE
        document.  It also provides a non-graphical underlying "toolkit"
        package to enable application developers to create a specialized
        application that uses an XTCE document, with minimal effort, when
        compared to attempting the task without the toolkit.</p>
    <p>The toolkit does not depend on any graphical
        interfaces.  To complement, the graphical user interface "xtceview"
        contains little to no business logic, preferring to be a graphical
        wrapper around the toolkit package.  To supplement this, a number of
        examples, sample databases, and schema documentation are also included
        in other packages.  All documentation can be accessed from the GUI
        Help Menu, assuming Java FX libraries are available.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><p>Supported by the author and tested regularly on Linux, Solaris,
                Mac OS/X, and Windows platforms.</p></li>
        <li><p>Telemetry Parameter access without needing to understand the XTCE
                data model, relationships, references, or other complexities.
            </p></li>
        <li><p>Similar Telecommand and Argument access without needing to
                understand the XTCE data model. (Still In Work)</p></li>
        <li><p>Telemetry and Telecommand Container/Packet processing supporting
            most of the XTCE schema complexity, reducing the output access to
            simple flattened accessors such that the user need not understand
            or be aware of the complexities of the XTCE data model.</p></li>
        <li><p>Extremely fast optimized searches for Parameters, Telecommands,
                and usage of Parameters in Containers/Packets.</p></li>
        <li><p>Support for Streams and ability to link from Streams to specific
                Containers/Packets.</p></li>
        <li><p>Ability to export from XTCE to other common formats, such as
                CSV, for use in a spreadsheet.</p></li>
        <li><p>Regression tested using Java standard JUnit 4 classes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Open Licensing via the Apache License model.</p></li>
        <li><p>The toolkit and GUI are both conceived with idea of editing as
            well as viewing in mind, although the edit features are only
            minimally complete.</p></li>
        <li><p>Round trip loading and saving operations while preserving
                comments and formatting.</p></li>
        <li><p>The toolkit and GUI have both been proven on programs that
            utilize both CCSDS Space Data Link and European ECSS Packet
            Utilization (PUS) standards.</p></li>
        <li><p>The toolkit and GUI are regularly used with satellite databases
            that incorporate XInclude and in total are hundreds of megabytes in
            size.  Performance was a strong consideration in the design.
            </p></li>
        <li><p>Full I18/L10 Internationalization with support currently
            installed for both US English and European French languages.  This
            package is actively used in Europe, in addition to the United
            States.</p></li>
        <li><p>An internal encoder and decoder for Parameters and Arguments
            that can serve as a reference for other implementations of
            commutation and de-commutation capabilities.</p></li>
    </ul>
