    <p>The XTCE Tools Java JAR file supports the XTCE technology by providing a
        Graphical User Interface named "xtceview" to view/browse/edit an XTCE
        document and also a non-graphical underlying "toolkit" package to
        enable any user to generate an application that uses an XTCE document
        with minimal effort.</p>
    <p>The toolkit does not depend on any graphical
        interfaces.  To complement, the graphical user interface "xtceview"
        contains little to no business logic, preferring to be a graphical
        wrapper around the toolkit package.  To supplement this, a number of
        examples, sample databases, and schema documentation are also included
        in other packages.  All documentation can be trivially accessed from
        the GUI Help Menu.</p>

    <h3>Key Features</h3>

    <ul style='list-style-type:disc'>
        <li>Telemetry Parameter access without needing to understand the XTCE
            data model, relationships, references, or other complexities.</li>
        <li>Similar Telecommand and Argument access without needing to
            understand the XTCE data model. (Still In Work)</li>
        <li>Telemetry and Telecommand Container/Packet processing supporting
            most of the XTCE schema complexity, reducing the output access to
            simple flattened accessors such that the user need not understand
            or be aware of the complexities of the XTCE data model.</li>
        <li>Extremely fast optimized searches for Parameters, Telecommands,
            and usage of Parameters in Containers/Packets.</li>
        <li>Support for Streams and ability to link from Streams to specific
            Containers/Packets.</li>
        <li>Ability to export from XTCE to common formats, such as CSV, and
            vendor specific formats such a Harris OS/Comet and L-3 InControl.
            (Vendor Formats Still In Work).  The author has significant
            experience using these vendor's products and highly recommends
            their XTCE support levels.</li>
        <li>Regression tested using Java standard JUnit 4 classes</li>
        <li>Open Source licensing not owned by any particular Corporation or
            Vendor.</li>
        <li>The toolkit and GUI are both conceived with idea of editing as well
            as viewing in mind, although the edit features are only minimally
            complete.</li>
        <li>Java JAXB and DOM are both in use in order to permit round trip
            XML load/save, as well as XPath support for unlimited query
            capability.</li>
        <li>The toolkit and GUI have both been extensively used on programs
            that utilize CCSDS Space Data Link and even ECSS Packet Utilization
            (PUS) standards.</li>
        <li>The toolkit and GUI are regularly used with satellite databases
            that incorporate XInclude and in total are hundreds of megabytes in
            size.  Performance is a strong consideration.</li>
        <li>Full I18/L10 Internationalization with support currently installed
            for both US English and European French languages.  This package
            is actively used in Europe, in addition to the United States.</li>
    </ul>
