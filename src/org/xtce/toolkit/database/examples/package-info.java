/** This package contains example database files in XTCE format for use by the
 * toolkit examples and in some unit tests.
 *
 * <p>The XTCE Schema Document used for this toolkit is a hybrid of the XTCE
 * 1.1 and upcoming XTCE 1.2 specification.  Some XTCE 1.2 improvements were
 * needed by the author.  This XSD file is contained in the distribution jar
 * file, which is in the same folder as the JAXB generated classes.  It is
 * expected that this file is largely backwards compatible with XTCE 1.1,
 * although some incompatibilities are known to exist.</p>
