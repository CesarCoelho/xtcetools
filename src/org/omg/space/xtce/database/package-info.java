/** This package is JAXB generated classes that are derived from the XTCE
 * Schema Document.
 *
 * The XTCE Schema Document used for this toolkit is a hybrid of the XTCE 1.1
 * and upcoming XTCE 1.2 specification.  Some XTCE 1.2 improvements were needed
 * by the author.  This xsd file is contained in the distribution jar file in
 * the same folder as the JAXB generated classes.  It is expected that this
 * file is backwards compatible with XTCE 1.1, although that has not been
 * extensively tested.  To use an XTCE 1.1 compliant XML document, just load
 * the document and leave the delivered schema in place.
