/** This package is the XTCE Toolkit that provides a convenient and relatively
 * simple Application Programming Interface (API) to use an XTCE document from
 * an end user application.
 *
 * This package is generally used by first instantiating an XTCEDatabase object
 * from an existing file or using the new database file constructor.  Once the
 * database has been loaded and optionally validated against the schema, the
 * user may then read and write to TM/TC Parameters, Telecommand, and
 * Containers/Packets within the data model.  Examples can be found in the
 * org.omg.space.xtce.examples package.
